Shopping Trends Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
 This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding consumer
 shopping trends. By leveraging a dataset with detailed customer and purchase information,
 the analysis aims to uncover meaningful insights into purchasing behaviors, preferences,
 and patterns.
 
# Features of the Dataset
 
 The dataset includes the following key attributes:

 ● Color: Color of the purchased item.
 
 ● Season: Season during which the purchase was made.
 
 ● ReviewRating: Customer feedback rating for the purchased item.
 
# Objectives:
 
 ● Perform a comprehensive EDA to identify trends and patterns in shopping behavior.
 
 ● Analyze demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and their influence on purchasing
 habits.
 
 ● Examine product-related attributes like category, color, and size to uncover popular
 choices.
 
 ● Visualize data to highlight seasonal trends and geographical purchasing variations.
 
# Tools and Technologies:
 
 ● Python: Programming language for data analysis.
 
 ● Pandas&NumPy:Fordata manipulation and numerical analysis.
 
 ● Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.
 
 ● Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for documenting the analysis.
 
# Visuals and Key Insights:
 
 The project uses descriptive statistics and compelling visualizations to communicate
 findings. Examples include:
 ● Sales trends over time.
 
 ● Product category preferences segmented by demographics.
